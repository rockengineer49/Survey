# Survey
This code takes in the baseline survey code for a soil freeze project. Once there is real data, the base line will be replaced with actual survey and downhole survey will be attached. 
With the Project_Survey.csv file, the following analysis can be done:
1. A down hole survey graph showing the deviation the length of the pipe in the north and east direction as well as a north and east deviation path.
2. Points can be extracted for any elevation of the project. This will give the deviated northing and easting to be plotted in TEMP/W or other program.
